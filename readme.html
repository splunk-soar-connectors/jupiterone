    <h2>Steps to Configure the JupiterOne Phantom app's asset</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create an asset for the app in Phantom Platform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Log in to the JupiterOne platform.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Once logged in, a search box is shown where you can ask a question,
          enter a query, or run a full-text search.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please enter the following query in the search box: FIND
          jupiterone_account as a return a._accountId and press Enter.
        </li>
        <li>Copy the _accountId returned in output into any text editor.</li>
        <li>
          Click on <b>Settings</b> gear found at the top right corner and select
          <b>Account Parameters</b>.

        <li>
          Select the <b>USER API KEYS</b> section by clicking on <b>Key</b> icon
          available at the left side bottom of the page and create an API key by
          providing <b>Key name</b> and <b>Days before expiration</b>.
        </li>
        <li>The API Key would be created and would be displayed in a dialog box.</li>
        <li>
          Copy the <b>Token</b> value from the dialog box and paste it into any
          text editor as backup, as it won't be visible again. Once copied,
          click on Done.
        </li>
        <li>
          This token value is the <b>API Key</b> that will be used in the asset.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Log in to your Phantom platform.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>

          JupiterOne to its respective configuration parameter.
        </li>
        <li>Save the asset.</li>
        <li>
          Now, test the connectivity of the Phantom server to the JupiterOne
          instance by clicking on the <b>TEST CONNECTIVITY</b> button.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Explanation of the Asset Configuration Parameters</h2>

    <h2>Explanation of the JupiterOne Actions' Parameters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Test Connectivity (Action Workflow Details)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This action will test the connectivity of the Phantom server to the
            JupiterOne instance by making an initial API call to a minimal query
            using the provided asset configuration parameters.
          </li>
          <li>
            The action validates the provided asset configuration parameters.
            Based on the API call response, the appropriate success and failure
            message will be displayed when the action gets executed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Run Query</h3>
        Fetch the results from the JupiterOne platform for the given
        J1QL(JupiterOne Query Language) query. The pagination is implemented
        internally in this action which will paginate through the responses. The
        max results parameter can be used to limit the output responses. The
        data paths of the action contain the paths of response data that the
        queries (used for testing) returned.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Action Parameter: Query</b>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This parameter will accept the J1QL query for a JupiterOne
              platform. An error message will be shown if the J1QL query is
              invalid.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <b>Action Parameter: Max Results</b>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This parameter allows the user to limit the number of results. It
              expects a numeric value as an input. The default value is 250 for
              which it will fetch the first 250 results for a particular query.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <b>Action Parameter: Include Deleted</b>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This parameter includes recently deleted information in the
              results, when set to true.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <b>Examples:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Retrieve 10 results for the query 'find Record'.
                <ul>
                  <li>Query = "find Record"</li>
                  <li>Max Results = 10</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <b>Note:</b>
              Max Results value will be handled internally, which will paginate
              through the results for a particular query.
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
